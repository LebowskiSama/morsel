### Thoughts
<p>The app still needs some polish css wise in terms of input-morse gap and bootsrapped morse output for smaller screens and auto adjusting font-size. This app was done for the purpose of understanding how node-vue environment works and how it can be deployed to heroku in the shortest time possible.</p>

### Customize configuration
